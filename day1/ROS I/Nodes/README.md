Any executable that performs a set of tasks in a distributed system is called a node.

Nodes in ROS communicate with each other in several ways, including:

- Publishing messages to a topic
- Subscribing to messages on a topic
- Calling a service provided by another node
- Providing a service that other nodes can call
- Using the parameter server to share data between nodes

These communication methods allow nodes to work together to perform complex tasks in a distributed system.

Nodes can be generated using python scripts running as exectuables.

They can also be generated by building cpp source code and generating the respective executables.
